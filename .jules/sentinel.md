## 2024-05-24 - Data URI XSS Bypass via Obfuscated Delimiters
**Vulnerability:** XSS via data URIs using obfuscated delimiters (`&comma;` and `&semi;`) to bypass regex checks.
**Learning:** Browsers decode HTML entities in data URIs before parsing the scheme. If structural entities like semicolons and commas are not explicitly decoded during sanitization, regex patterns relying on them (like `dangerousUrisRegex`) can be bypassed (e.g., `data:text/html&semi;base64&comma;...`).
**Prevention:** Always decode obfuscated structural entities (`&semi;`, `&comma;`) during XSS string sanitization prior to applying regex-based URI blocklists.
